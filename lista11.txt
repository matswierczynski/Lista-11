I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
Now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering somethin' brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh I Oh I Oh I Oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I Oh I Oh I Oh I 
I'm in love with your body
Oh I Oh I Oh I Oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
